# indraniel_fqgrep-binder
Analysis of sequencing data using indraniel/fqgrep, *an approximate sequence pattern matcher for FASTQ/FASTA files*, in Jupyter sessions provided via MyBinder.org. Adapt the demonstrations to analyze your data and create reports.

*tl;dr:*  
Click any `launch binder` badge on this page to use the demonstrations inside your browser.

See [the source repo for Indraniel Das' fqgrep here](https://github.com/indraniel/fqgrep) for more about the software.

**Note if you are interested in this software, see [my fqgrep-binder repo](https://github.com/fomightez/fqgrep-binder) where I demonstrate Fulcrum Genomics' fqgrep, and I also mention Patmatch which belongs in discussions of this sort of software. However, Patmatch only works with FASTA files.**

------------------

You more likely are interested [Fulcrum Genomics' fqgrep](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fqgrep)!! It is much more current and better maintained than [Indraniel Das' fqgrep here](https://github.com/indraniel/fqgrep).  
I have a nice demostration site for Fulcrum Genomics' fqgrep that you can easily run via MyBinder-served sessions without installing anything on your machine, see [my fqgrep-binder repo](https://github.com/fomightez/fqgrep-binder).
